🚗 Car Price Prediction – A Machine Learning Project
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars using Linear Regression. It simulates a real-world scenario where car price estimation is essential for both buyers and sellers. The model is trained on a dataset containing attributes like car year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, ownership type, etc.
